## Getting a local copy of athanor-server

Clone the github repository to your local repository copy on your PC, or
download the zip file if you just want to build the project, and have no intention
to submit a contribution.

To clone the project, position to the directory where you want the local repository placed
(Your home directory is fine) and issue the following command.
This will create a copy of the repository in the athanor-server directory.

        git clone https://github.com/uts-cic/athanor-server
